Drag & Drop Task Management Panel (Monorepo)

This is a full-stack monorepo project that combines a powerful NestJS + PostgreSQL + TypeORM backend with a modern Next.js + React DnD frontend.
It provides a drag-and-drop task management panel, allowing users to create, update, and organize tasks visually. The backend manages authentication and database operations, while the frontend delivers a smooth and responsive UI for task interaction.

The project is structured into two main folders:

frontend → Next.js (React + React DnD)

backend → NestJS, PostgreSQL, TypeORM
